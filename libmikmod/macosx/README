  Hello folks !


This is libmikmod, version 3.2.0-beta1, a portable sound library for Unix.
Check out the file 'NEWS' for more history information.


>> BUILDING LIBMIKMOD
---------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for Mac OS X, then you're lost
  in the sources. Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

- If you are building for classic Mac OS, you might want to look at the
  top-level "macintosh" directory instead which has the old CFM stuff ?
  

libmikmod can be built using Apple's "Developer Tools" environments.
(or you can use the commandline UNIX stuff, just go up one directory)

Read the file INSTALL in this directory for compilation instructions.
The projects will generate code for Mac OS X versions 10.1 - 10.3

HTML documentation of the library, for programmers, is located in the
doc directory.

For more information on this port, please contact Anders Bjoerklund

>> THANKS
---------

We would like to thank everyone who contributed to libmikmod. Their
names are in the AUTHORS file for the significative contributions, but
some other names can be found in the NEWS file. Thanks a lot ! Keeping
libmikmod alive wouldn't be much fun without you.

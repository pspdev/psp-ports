>> BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR libmikmod FOR MAC OS X
------------------------------------------------

You can always use the UNIX commandline tools
instead of the IDE projects in this directory.

Go to the top level and follow the INSTALL there...
(Hint: "./configure && make && sudo make install")

In that case your files will end up under /usr/local.
The IDE stuff will end up under a "build" directory.



Mac OS X 10.1 "Puma"
-------------

1) Go to the Apple store. http://store.apple.com

2) Purchase a new version of Mac OS X. (for $129)
   It comes with a newer version Developer Tools.


Mac OS X 10.2 "Puma"
-------------

1) You should be using the December 2002 Dev Tools.

2) Open "libmikmod.pbproj" with Project Builder.


Mac OS X 10.3 "Panther"
-------------

1) You should be using Xcode 1.1 Dev Tools, or up.

2) Open "libmikmod.xcode" with the Xcode app.



The frameworks come in two versions, Carbon and CoreAudio.
Carbon uses the old Macintosh Sound Manager driver,
and CoreAudio uses the new Mac OS X CoreAudio driver.

Unless you are building an application to be used from
Mac OS 9 too (which these tools won't do anyway), the
CoreAudio driver is recommended - since it's better...


Enjoy!

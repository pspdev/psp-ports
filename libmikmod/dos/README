  Hello folks !


This is libmikmod, version 3.2.0-beta1, a portable sound library for DOS.
DOS support is new in this version, your comments and critics are welcome.


>> BETA WARNING
---------------

This is a *beta* version of libmikmod. Although it should work fine on
almost all systems, there are likely a few last-minute errors or typos
in the source, and some parts have not received enough hours of testing yet.

Also, please note that all features planned for the final 3.2.0 release are not
available yet. Some structures or functions may change. This release is mainly
intended to the libmikmod developers to share a common base for adding new
features...

The library programming documentation (in docs/) is mostly up-to-date... It
lacks the Player_QueryVoices documentation, though.

If you're not scared, then you can proceed and enjoy fewer bugs than in the
previous version (-;


>> BUILDING LIBMIKMOD
---------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for DOS, then you're lost in the sources.
  Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

This port has been designed to work only with DJGPP compiler. However, it
should not be too complex to make it compile with any other compiler. If you
manage to make libmikmod compile and work with another compiler, we'd like to
hear from you. You'll likely have to write an appropiate makefile, or build
things manually ...

If you have all proper tools installed, just type

	make -fMakefile.dj

There is a catch if you have some PC-like GREP (i.e. Borland GREP) somewhere on
your path before actual GNU grep... you can check this by just typing "grep".
GNU grep should output:

	Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
	Try `grep --help' for more information.

If you see something other, place your djgpp/bin path earlier in PATH list.
After this the build process should complete painlessly.

To make your library ready to use, copy the files 'libmikmod.a' and
'include/mikmod.h' to your '%DJGPP%/lib' and '%DJGPP%/include' directories
respectively.

HTML documentation of the library, for programmers, is located in the doc
directory.


>> SUPPORTED SOUNDCARDS
-----------------------

Currently three brands of sound cards are supported under DOS:

- Gravis Ultrasound and compatibles. Not tested with Interwave cards. If
  somebody has one and can debug the code under Interwave, please drop us a note
  (see email at bottom).

- SoundBlaster and compatibles. There is only one driver that supports all
  flavours of SoundBlasters:

	+ SB original (8-bit mono, 22KHz)
	+ SB 2.0 (DMA autoinit mode -> less clicks, 44KHz 8-bit mono).
	+ SB Pro (8-bit 22KHz stereo, 8-bit 44KHz mono)
	+ SB 16+ (8- and 16-bit stereo, up to 44Khz both)

  Note that SB16 should cover AWE32/64 as well... however, the code for SB16
  has not been tested (although there is little SB16-specific code, but
  anyway...). If someone can test/debug it, please notify us (or at least
  report what doesn't work).

- Windows Sound System and compatibles. Most today SoundBlaster clones
  (including the CS4236B card used for testing) emulates (in hardware) WSS.
  That's because Creative Labs copyrighted the SB16 interface and thus
  clonemakers cannot do similar hardware without violating their rights, so
  most of them only emulate SB Pro (see above).

  WSS supports up to 44KHz 16-bit stereo. The following playback rates (in both
  8- and 16-bit) are supported: 5510, 6620, 8000, 9600, 11025, 16000, 18900,
  22050, 27420, 32000, 33075, 37800, 44100 and 48000 Hz.

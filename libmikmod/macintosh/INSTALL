>> BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR libmikmod FOR MACINTOSH
-------------------------------------------------

Requirements (to run):
- 68020 or PowerPC Macintosh
- Sound Manager 2.0 or above
- CFM68K for 680X0 shared library

Requirements (to compile):
- Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro
- Apple MPW

Platforms (either one of):
- System 7
- Mac OS 9
- Mac OS X (10.1 and up)


>> COMPILING
------------

To fix the file type and creators:

If you downloaded this library from the main site, there is a good chance
that the types and creators of the various files are messed up and it won't
build because of that. There is an AppleScript supplied, that will fix this.

On Mac OS X, you should be able to open the text file "FixTypeAndCreators.applescript"
Run this script, choosing the top "libmikmod" folder - and all should then be fixed.
On Mac OS 9, if you have trouble opening the AppleScript because it *too* lacks the
type and creator - there is a BinHex version in "FixTypeAndCreators.hqx". Use that.

The script sets the creator to CodeWarrior, but is needed for the MPW builds as well.
Note that all the files use UNIX line breaks (\n), and not the regular Mac ones (\r).


To compile and build :

A) Using CodeWarrior
--------------------

1) Open "libmikmod-cw#.mcp" with CodeWarrior IDE
2) Set Current Target : "¥ All Libraries"
3) Make, or "Bring Up To Date"

Temporary stuff (can be deleted afterwards)
- "libmikmod-cw# Data" folder

CodeWarrior version Pro 5 or Pro 6 is needed to open the supplied projects.
If you have an older or newer version of CodeWarrior, you should be able to
convert the project by opening it and choosing OK when it asks to convert.

The Pro 5 version builds 68K and PPC targets for regular Macintosh (System 7),
and the Pro 6 version builds Classic (Mac OS 9) and Carbon (Mac OS X) targets.

At the moment there is no support for Mach-O linkage or the CoreAudio driver
when using Metrowerks CodeWarrior, it would require updating to CodeWarrior 8.
It might come in the future, but for now it is CFM and the Carbon driver only.


B) Using MPW
------------

1) Open MPW Shell
2) Run the Script : "BuildLibmikmod"

Temporary stuff (can be deleted afterwards)
- "libmikmod.makeout" textfile
- "obj","objppc" folders

Currently the 68K build doesn't work because the default Symantec compiler
lacks "long long" (64-bit) int support and also support for prefix headers.

MPW can be downloaded for free from http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/
Updating your Universal Interfaces to the latest version (3.4) is recommended.

The MPW makefile does not build any Carbon or Mac OS X targets.
Use Apple's new freely available Developer Tools for that instead.


>> TARGETS
----------

SYSTEM 7

Builds the following files:
- libmikmod				# Fat (680X0+PowerPC) Shared Library    ['shlb']
- libmikmodStub			# Fat Stub Link Library (no code/data)  ['stub']

The various parts that are mixed into the above fat libraries:
- libmikmod68k.lib		# 680X0 stub library
- libmikmodPPC.lib		# PowerPC stub library
- libmikmod68k.dll		# 680X0 shared library
- libmikmodPPC.dll		# PowerPC shared library
(these 4 files can be deleted, since they are also present in the fat libs)

MAC OS 9 / MAC OS X

- libmikmod.lib			# PowerPC stub library, for both Classic/Carbon
- libmikmodClassic.dll	# PowerPC shared library, links to InterfaceLib
- libmikmodCarbon.dll	# PowerPC shared library, links to CarbonLib

STATIC LIBRARIES

- libmikmod.o           # 680X0 Static Library for MPW
- libmikmod.x           # PowerPC Static Library for MPW
- libmikmod 68k         # 680X0 Static Library for CodeWarrior
- libmikmod PPC			# PowerPC Static Library for CodeWarrior

- libmikmod Classic		# Static Library for CodeWarrior (TARGET_API_MACOS8)
- libmikmod Carbon		# Static Library for CodeWarrior (TARGET_API_CARBON)


>> INSTALLING
-------------

Mac OS:
Move "libmikmod" to the Extensions folder of your System Folder.
Move "libmikmodStub" and "mikmod.h" to your Compiler Folder, for instance
(just somewhere along your libmikmod-using project's search path)

These three files (libmikmod,libmikmodStub, mikmod.h) with installer
can also be downloaded directly from my web page (see URL below).
If you have troubles compiling them yourself, that is.

Mac OS X:
There is no official place to put them, since it only uses frameworks now.
You can bundle the shared libraries next to your app, or link statically.
(frameworks and other such nextisms are located in the "macosx" folder)

Future Mac OS X support will take place using gcc and the Xcode IDE.
(unless someone donates a copy of Metrowerks CodeWarrior 8 or 9 ;) )


Enjoy!
